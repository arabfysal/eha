                <p> A living museum of Borneo’s rain forest, the Rainforest Discovery Center is the perfect place to witness specimens in their natural habitats. Acting as a reserve of sorts for much of Borneo’s unique wildlife with minor replanting and controlled climates, the center educates visitors on the varieties of deep rain forest plants that normally take hours and expert eyes to spot in the wild. It also neighbors the Oran Utan Rehabilitation Centre, and they collaborate in the hopes remaining relevant tourist attractions to keep the place well looked after and funded.</p>
