						<div class="ingredient">
							<ul>
								<li>500g / 4 cups flour</li>
								<li>225g butter (50g shredded)</li>
								<li>1 cup warm milk</li>
								<li>4 tbs sugar</li>
								<li>2 tsp salt</li>
								<li>Yeast (1tbs + 1tsp)</li>
								<li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

							<li>
								Begin by proofing the yeast. Add sugar to the milk, dissolve it and the add the yeast. Set it aside and let it proof. It should cool off before adding it in the next step.
							</li>
							<li>
								In a bowl, combine the flour, salt and shredded butter. The butter has to be really cold. Pour in  the yeast-milk mix together until a dough is formed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Wrap the dough in a cling film or an air-tight plastic wrap and put it in the fridge to rest. Let is stay overnight if you start preparing in the evening. This works best for me. For when you are in a hurry and do not have much time to spare, just chill it in the fridge for about 2 to 3 hours and your are good to go.
							</li>
							<li>
								While the dough is chilling, cut the butter into squares or sticks and arrange horizontally on a plastic wrap or parchment paper. Cover with another wrap/paper and roll into a rectangular shape about 8 by 5 inches in size. Put back into the fridge to chill as well.
							</li>
							<li>
								After an hour, bring out the dough, remove from the wrap and place onto a floured surface
							</li>

							<li>Proof yeast with water and sugar for 10 minutes </li>
							<li>In a bowl, add flour along with salt and minced garlic (optional to add at this point). Make sure the garlic is distributed evenly and does not clog up in one place</li>
							<li>Add the proofed yeast mixture and knead (for 10 minutes with hand or 5 minutes with mixer) into a dough</li>
							<li>Lastly, incorporate oil into the dough</li>
							<li>Set aside and let it rise for about an hour or until it doubles in size</li>
							<li>Transfer onto a floured board and deflate. Add minced garlic to the dough at this point before you begin cutting</li>
							<li>Divide into 6-7 balls and roll into circles</li>
							<li>Cook on a non-stick pan on medium-low heat for 2 minutes(on each side). No need to grease the pan since its a non-stick one, plus you will be brushing the finished product with butter later on</li>
							<li>Melt butter, add herbs to it and stir well</li>
							<li>Flip and brush with butter-herb mixture</li>
							<li>Your naan is ready!</li>

								<li>5 string cheese (each cut into half, making 10 sticks)</li>

								<li>1 tsp chilli powder</li>

							<li>Mix flour with chili powder in a bowl and set aside.</li>
							<li>Add Italian seasoning to breadcrumbs and set aside as well.</li>
							<li>Whisk egg and water/milk.</li>
							<li>Dip cheese strings in the flour mixture first, then dip into egg, then into breadcrumbs. If you want it to be even more breaded, you will have to dip into egg and back to breadcrumbs again. That is, you will have two coatings of breadcrumbs.</li>
							<li>Deep fry in hot oil for 1 minute or maximum of 2 minutes. Keep an eye on it and take out once the crust is golden brown to prevent the melting cheese from spilling out. Make sure your oil is hotttttt before you begin frying</li>
							<li>Drain on a strainer or paper towel and enjoy with your favorite sauce</li>
