			<h2>Ehealth</h2>
				<p>Over the decades, there has been tremendous development in the way we process and transmit information in the health care sector. These developments make research in the field of Health Information Systems both challenging and interesting.</p>
				<p>Health information, though Haux has tried to distinguish the two, with Hospital Information System being one instance of Health Information System, would be used interchangeably in this article.</p>
				<p>The Purpose of HIS is primarily to deliver high quality patient care. The relevance of these information system has been captured by Reinhold in the scenario below</p>
				<div id="quote">
					<p>Imagine the following situation: Ursula B. was pregnant with quintuplets. She had already spent more than 5 months in the Heidelberg University Medical Center. She had to spend most of this time lying in bed. During the course of her pregnancy, her physical problems increased. From the 28th week on, she suffered severe respiratory distress.</p>
					<p>The paediatrician, who was also involved in her treatment, had the following question: what are the chances of the infants being born healthy at this gestational age?
					He went to a computer, a ‘health care professional workstation’ available on his ward and in his office. Such a workstation can be used for a variety of tasks. It is connected to the computer network of the Heidelberg University Medical Center. The physician called up a ‘medical knowledge server’ and one of its components, a bibliographic database (MEDLINE). This database contains the current state of the art of medical knowledge worldwide. The medical knowledge server can be accessed at any time and from any of the more than 3000 health care professional workstations of the Heidelberg University Medical Center.</p>
					<p>The following information resulted from this consultation of the medical knowledge server. Several publications stated that only slim chances exist for all infants to survive in good health. If they are born during the 28th week of pregnancy, the chance for survival is about 15%. In case of birth during the 30th week, their chances would improve to about 75%. Also, according to the literature, further delay of the delivery does not improve the prognosis of the quintuplets. The physician discussed the results with the expectant mother. Despite her respiratory problems, she had the strength to endure 2 more weeks. On January 21st, 1999, the quintuplets were born well and healthy at the Heidelberg University Medical Center. A team of 25 physicians, nurses and midwives assisted during the delivery. The costs for such a medical knowledge server for a complete medical center are generally lower than the costs for one ultrasound scanner, provided that the information system of the medical center offers a minimum infrastructure.</p>
					<p>A medical knowledge server, as an integrated part of a hospital information system could not be realized in 1984, at the time of Peter Reichertz’ speech. This one was introduced by the Department of Medical Informatics of the University of Heidelberg in 1992. At that time, it was one of the first installations of its kind in the world. Nowadays, through global access to knowledge and through our networking capacities, such features can be implemented at low cost in every health care setting and can be used at any time at the health care professional's workplace.</p>

				<p>It could be deduced that – and of course there is a hypothesis that – efficient, high quality patient care delivery is directly proportional to the availability of an efficient HIS.</p>

			<h2>Edtech</h2>
				<p>Edtech is derived from two word: education and technology. E-learning is a product of edtech that has become a big industry itself. The e-learning industry is a multi-billion dollar industry. Udemy has a market valuation of $173m (investopedia, 2017), while coursera's worth has been put at $1b (Forbes, 2018) and Khan Academy has raised $44m in revenue (wikipedia).</p>
				<p>I like e-learning myself. As an enthusiast, I would say a good e-learnig system should have these three characteristic: 1, it is personlised in the sense that every user would feel as though the system is built exactly for him alone, and 2, it is interactive</p>
				<p>I believe that the future of e-learning is especially bright in Nigeria with a population of 203million, median age of 18.4years and internet penetration at 47.1%</p>
